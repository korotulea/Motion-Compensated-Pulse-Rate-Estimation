## Part 2: Clinical Application Overview

Now we can use pulse rate algorithm to compute more clinically meaningful features and discover healthcare trends.

Specifically, 24 hours of heart rate data from 1500 samples were used to try to validate the well known trend that average resting heart rate increases up until middle age and then decreases into old age. We'll also see if resting heart rates are higher for women than men. See the trend illustrated in this image:

### Dataset (CAST)

The data from this project comes from the [Cardiac Arrythmia Suppression Trial (CAST)](https://physionet.org/content/crisdb/1.0.0/), which was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). CAST collected 24 hours of heart rate data from ECGs from people who have had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the past two years.<sup>1</sup> This data has been smoothed and resampled to more closely resemble PPG-derived pulse rate data from a wrist wearable.<sup>2</sup>
